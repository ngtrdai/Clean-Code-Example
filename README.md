### Variables - Name rules
1. Use meaningful and pronounceable names

```php
$moment = new DateTime();
// Example for variable names not meaningful
$ymdstr = $moment->format('y-m-d');
list($y, $m, $d) = explode('-', $ymdstr);
$timestamp = mktime(0, 0, 0, $m, $d, $y);

// Example for variable names meaningful
$today = $moment->format('y-m-d');
list($year, $month, $day) = explode('-', $today);
$timestamp = mktime(0, 0, 0, $month, $day, $year);
```
2. Avoid disinformation

```Programmers must avoid leaving false clues that obscure the meaning of code. We should avoid words whose entrenched meanings vary from our intended meaning```

```php
// Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless itâ€™s actually a List.
$accountList = []; 
// Example for meaningful
$accounts = [];
$acoountGroup = [];
```
3. Do not use a variable name that is the same as the name of a class
```php
// Do not use a variable name that is the same as the name of a class.
class Account
{
    public function __construct()
    {
    }
}

$account = new Account();

// Example for meaningful
$accountInfo = new Account();
```
4. Use searchable names
5. Avoid mental mapping
### Function rules
### Comment
### Object and data structures
### Error Handling
### SOLID
### Coding Convention in PHP
